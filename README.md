## This wasn't supposed to be hard

If you look online, it's fucking crazy how many developer-hours have been sunk into trying to make iPhone Safari play sounds. What initially seems like it should be the simplest thing in the world is just the entry-point to a rabbit hole full of worms, sitting on the tip of an iceberg. All of this because Apple - in their infinite wisdom - decided to make Safari refuse to play sounds unless the user initiated them with a tap.

Enough. This ends, now.

Just drop an `audio` controller on your `body` and you will have a fully unlocked audio player available.

## Setup

First, add stimulus-audio to your `package.json`:

`yarn add stimulus-audio`

Add stimulus-audio to your main JS entry point or Stimulus controllers root folder:

```js
import { Application } from 'stimulus'
import Audio from 'stimulus-audio'

import { definitionsFromContext } from 'stimulus/webpack-helpers'
const application = Application.start()
const context = require.context('../controllers', true, /\.js$/)
application.load(definitionsFromContext(context))

// Manually register Audio as a Stimulus controller
application.register('audio', Audio)
```

Add an `audio` controller to your `body`:

```html
<body data-controller="audio"></body>
```

Finally, you can play sounds from anywhere in your application using the `audio` accessor from the DOM element you put the controller on. This is a reference to a standard [Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement/Audio) object, which supports `play`, `pause` and many other family favorites.

```js
document.body.audio.src = 'https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/858/outfoxing.mp3'
document.body.audio.play()
```

Note that `play()` returns a Promise, so you can do this:

```js
document.body.audio.play()
  .then(() => console.log('The song has started.'))
  .catch(err => console.log('There was an error:', err))
```
